            <h2><span style="color: orangered;">I Am Legend</span> Explained (Alternate Endings Vs Book)</h2>
            <p>I am Legend is a 2007 sci-fi thriller that tells the story of a military virologist trying to find a cure for a contagious virus that has turned people into vampire-like creatures. It’s based on the book I am Legend (1954) by Richard Matheson, to which Warner Bros has had the rights since 1970. In fact, in 1971, the company had already made a movie (The Omega Man) based on the book. The 2007 movie has two endings and differs quite a bit from the book. Before we get into that, let’s explore the story and the themes. Here’s the plot and the alternate endings of I Am Legend explained in comparison to the book; spoilers ahead.
